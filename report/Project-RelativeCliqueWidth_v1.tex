% ABSTRACT %
\begin{abstract}
Many NP-hard problems are solvable in polynomial time for graphs having a bounded tree width, and correspondingly, having a bounded clique width \cite{vadim-lozin}. Vadim Lozin and Dieter Rautenbach in \cite{vadim-lozin} introduced a polynomial time factor 2 approximation algorithm to determine relative clique width of a graph. And more interestingly this algorithm determines exactly relative clique width with respect to a linear reduced term.

This report is about the implementation of this algorithm for the case of linear reduced terms, as well as about the program we developed to support a visual usage for users.
\end{abstract}

% INTRODUCTION %
\section {Introduction}
Clique width \cite{linear-time} is an important graph parameter in the meaning that many NP-hard problems are solvable in polynomial time for graphs with bounded clique width. However calculating clique width of a graph is NP-complete \cite {np-complete}, it's related to determining the minimum number of labels used in constructing the graph by operations. In \cite {vadim-lozin},  Vadim Lozin and Dieter Rautenbach took a new approach. It deals with another problem, determining relative clique width. In fact clique width of a graph is the minimum of its relative clique widths over all so-called "reduced terms". 

Although the authors confirmed that the problem is NP-hard, a polynomial time approximation algorithm was introduced. Moreover the algorithm computes exactly the relative clique width in a special case.

In the next sections, we will give a brief overview about clique width and relative clique width, detail the algorithm with a practical example. Then we will explain our implementation for this algorithm

% DEFINATION AND OBJECTIVES %
\section {Definition and Objective}
Hereafter we introduce necessary definitions and notations used in this report, then we will present the algorithm given in \cite{vadim-lozin} for the case of linear reduced term.

%subsection 2.1 clique width%
\subsection{Clique width}
Clique width is an important graph parameter in the sense that many NP-hard problems are solvable for graphs with bounded clique width

Give a simple graph \textit {G(V,E)} (in the context of this articale we only deal with simple, undirected and loop-free graphs), clique width of the graph is defined via labeling vertices of graph and constructing graph through operations. 

\begin{description}
\item [{Definition}] \cite {vadim-lozin} \textit {(labeling a vertex)} \textit {C} is a finite set, a labeled vertex \textit {$v\in V$} is denoted by \textit {i(v)} with $i\in C$, we also call \textit {i(v)} an i-port 
\end{description}

Then we can have a mapping: 
\[
\gamma:V\rightarrow C
\]
Three 3 kinds of operations are defined: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Relabeling: denoted by symbol $\rho_{a\rightarrow b}$ : makes all vertices labeled by\textit {a} become labeled by \textit {b} 
\item Edge addition: denoted by symbol $\eta_{a,b}$ : creates edges between vertices labeled by \textit {a} and vertices labeled by \textit {b} 
\item Disjoint union: denoted by symbol $\oplus$ : disjoint union is commutative 
\end{enumerate}

The process of constructing graph is denoted as an expression of labeled vertices and these three kinds of operations.  An expression with k labels is called k-expression. In this report we call such an expression a term. 

\begin{description}
\item [{Example}] We use an example from \cite {vadim-lozin}, have a following term
\[
t=\eta_{b,c}(((\rho_{b\to a}(\eta_{b,c}((\eta_{a,b}(a(1)\oplus b(2)))\oplus c(3))))\oplus b(4))\oplus(\eta_{a,c}(\eta_{a,b}(a(5)\oplus b(6)))\oplus c(7)))
\]
\end{description}

This term denotes the following graph.\\

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering{}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{image/graph_by_t}
\caption{Graph by term t}
\end{figure}

Because there may be more than one way to construct a graph, therefore we can have many terms \textit {t }that denote the same graph (two graphs are considered to be the same if they are isomorphic). For such a term \textit {t}, we define \textit {$val(t)=(G,\gamma)$} 

\begin{description}
\item [{Definition}] \cite {vadim-lozin}The \textit {(Clique width)}\textit {cw(G)} of a graph G  is defined as follows: 
\[
cw(G)=min\{\mid C\mid\mid\exists t:val(t)=(G,\gamma)\}
\]
\end{description}

Calculating clique width of a graph is an NP-complete problem.

% section 2.2 Relative clique width%
\subsection{Relative clique width}
Vadim Lozin and Dieter Rautenbach in \cite {vadim-lozin} made a new approach to the problem of determining clique width by introducing the notion of \textit {relative clique width}. 

\begin{description}
\item [{Definition}] \cite {vadim-lozin} \textit {(Reduced term)} a reduced term \textit {r} of a term \textit {t} is a term acquired by replacing in \textit {t} all symbols \textit {i(v)} by \textit {v}, and removing all symbols $\rho_{a\rightarrow b}$ and $\eta_{a,b}$  \item [{Example}] for a term \textit {t} as above, we have the reduced term \textit {r} as follows: 
\[
r=red(t)=(((((((1\oplus2))\oplus 3)))\oplus 4)\oplus(((5\oplus6))\oplus 7))=(((1\oplus2)\oplus3)\oplus 4)\oplus((5\oplus 6)\oplus 7)
\]
\end{description}

This reduced term denotes a rooted binary tree

\begin{description}
\item [{Definition}] \cite {vadim-lozin} \textit {(relative clique width)} relative clique width of a graph G with respect to a reduced term r, \textit {cw(G,r)} is defined as follow: 
\[
cw(G,r)=min\{\mid C\mid\mid\exists t:val(t)=(G,\gamma)\wedge red(t)=r\}
\]
\end{description}

In \cite {vadim-lozin} they introduced a factor 2 algorithm to approximate\textit {cw(G,r)}. An interesting thing is the algorithm can determine exactly in the case reduced terms are linear

\begin{description}
\item [{Definition}] \textit {(linear reduced term)} a reduced term \textit {r} is linear if and only if $\forall$ sub-term $s_{1}\oplus s_{2}$ of r, $\exists i\in\{1,2\}:s_{i}$ has form of \textit {v} 
\item [{Example}] following is an example of a linear reduced term 
\[
r=(((1\oplus(2\oplus3))\oplus4)\oplus5)\oplus6
\]
\end{description}

This term denotes the following rooted binary tree:\\

% section 2.3 graph H %
\subsection{$Graph H_{s}$}

In what follows, we introduce a very important notation used in the algorithm, we denote by \textit {$N_{G}(u)$} the neighborhood of vertex \textit {u} in graph \textit {G} 

\begin{description}
\item [{Definition}] \cite {vadim-lozin} For a sub-term \textit {s} of \textit {r}, let \textit {$V_{s}$} denote the set of vertices in s. We define a graph \textit {$H_{s}=(V_{s}, E_{s})$} with $uv\in E_{s}\Longleftrightarrow N_{G}(u)\setminus V_{s}\neq N_{G}(v)\setminus V_{s}$
\end{description}

\textit{$H_{s}$} is a complete multi-partite graph (lemma 1 in \cite{vadim-lozin}), let \textit{$E_{s}$} be the complement graph of \textit{$H_{s}$}, so we have edge relation is an equivalent relation on \textit{$E_{s}$}

% section 2.4 Algorithm%
\subsection{Algorithm}

This algorithm determines \textit {cw(G, r)} by recursively construction of a term \textit {t} such that \textit {t} satisfies definition of \textit {cw(G,r)}. After that we can approximate \textit {cw(G, r)} (and determine exactly if  \textit {r} is linear). Let \textit {s} is a sub-term of \textit {r}, we construct \textit {t(r)} recursively as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item If $s=v\in V$, then $t(s)=i(v),i\in C$ 
\item If $s=s_{1}\oplus s_{2}$, then $t(s)=\beta_{l}(\beta_{l-1}(...(\beta_{1}(\alpha_{k}(\alpha_{k-1}(...(\alpha_{1}(t(s_{1})\oplus t(s_{2})))))))))$, with \textit {$\alpha_{1},...,\alpha_{k}$} have form of $\eta_{i,j}$ and \textit {$\beta_{1},...,\beta_{l}$} have form of $\rho_{i\rightarrow j}$ such that following conditions must be satisfied

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit {$val(t(s))=(G[Vs],\gamma_{t(s)})$} 
\item \textit {red(t(s)) = s} 
\item $\forall u,v\in V_{s},\gamma_{t(s)}(u)=\gamma_{t(s)}(v)\Leftrightarrow uv\notin E_{s}$,
it means \textit {$\gamma_{t(s)}$}assigns the same label to two vertices iff they stay in the same partite set of \textit {$H_{s}$} 
\item \textit {$\gamma_{t(s_{1})}\cap\gamma_{t(s_{2})}=\emptyset$} \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

Algorithm 1 is pseudo-code of a recursive function constructing a term for a linear reduced term {$s=rTerm\oplus vertex$}. This function uses some notations of Java programming language

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Term constructing algorithm}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Function{constructTerm}{$rTerm, vertex$, graph}
	\If {$rTerm\ \textbf{is}\ ProperTerm$}
		\State {$leftTerm \gets constructTerm(rTerm.left, rTerm.right)$}
	\Else
		\State  {$leftTerm \gets constructPort(rTerm)$}
	\EndIf
	\State {$port \gets constructPort(vertex)$}
	\State {$usedLabels \gets leftTerm.usedLabels \cup port.usedLabels$}
	\Comment{usedLabels is the set of labels is used in this term}
	\State {$V_{s} \gets leftTerm.vertexSet \cup port.vertexSet$}
	\State {$constructHs(V_{s})$, graph}
	\State partites {$\gets$} constructHsPartites(leftTerm.partites{$\cup$}port.partites)
	\State {$gammaImage \gets \emptyset$}
	\Comment{gammaImage will be $\gamma_t(s)$}
	\State operatorList {$\gets$} constructOperatorList(leftTerm, port,
                partites, graph, gammaImage)\linebreak
	\Comment{constructOperatorList returns list of operators of a term, and computes the image of mapping $\gamma_t(s)$ as well}
	\State \Return \textbf{new}\ ProperTerm(snTerm, port, termVs, usedlabel,
                gammaImage, partites, operatorList);
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}

\end{algorithm}

With condition (c), we need to determine partite sets of \textit {$H_{s}$}. Fortunately, we get an algorithm to do that from Lemma 2 in \cite {vadim-lozin} : 

\begin{quotation}
If $s=s_{1}\oplus s_{2}$ is a sub-term of r, then every partite sets of \textit {$H_{s}$}is a union of partite sets of $H_{s_{1}}$ and $H_{s_{2}}$ 
\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
Call $U_{s_{1}}$and $U_{s_{2}}$is sets of partite set of $H_{s_{1}}$ and $H_{s_{2}}$, we have Algorithm 2 as follows:
\end{quotation}

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{Partite sets determining algorithm}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
	\State $U\gets U_{s_{1}} \cup U_{s_{2}}$ 
	\While{$U\neq\emptyset$}
		\State $partiteSets\leftarrow\emptyset$
		\ForAll{$u\in U$}
			\State $vertexU\gets u.get(0)$
			\ForAll{$vertex\in vertexSet$}
				\State $contained\gets true$
				\If{$(vertex,vertexU)\in H_{s}$}
					\State $contained\gets false$
					\State break
				\EndIf
			\EndFor
			\If{$contained$}
				\State $partiteSets\gets u$
				\State $U.remove(u)$
			\EndIf
		\EndFor
	\EndWhile 
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

% section 2.5 A practical example%
\subsection{A practical example}

To make an example, we will run manually the relative clique determining algorithm with following input:
\begin{itemize}
\item A Graph with 6 vertices\\
 
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering{}

\end{figure}

\item Linear reduced term $r=(((1\oplus(2\oplus3))\oplus4)\oplus5)\oplus6$
\item Set of label \textit {\{'a', ..., 'z'\}}
\end{itemize}

It's easy to see that actually the algorithm does the recursion on the structure of \textit {s} (a tree-like structure). However to keep the illustration for this algorithm clear and simple, instead of going
top-down from the root of the tree, we will describe the illustration directly, bottom up from the deepest leaves (see an example of a rooted binary tree above).

% 3. IMPLEMENTATION THE ALGORITHMS %
\section {Implementation of the algorithm}
This section is an introduction about the work we have done, that is write a program to realize this algorithm. First of all we will summarize the requirements from the advisor, then introduce briefly the program.

%section 3.1 Requirement specification}%
\subsection{Requirement specification}

The program takes following as input: 
\begin{itemize}
\item The number of vertices of a graph
\item The list of edges of the graph, for example: \textit {((1, 2) , (2, 3) , (3, 4) , (4, 5) , (5, 6))}
\item A linear reduced term r. We denote graph operators in ASCII sequence as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit {oplus(..., ...)} for $...\oplus...$
\item \textit {rel\_a\_b} for $\rho_{a\rightarrow b}$
\item \textit {add\_a\_b} for $\eta_{a,b}$
\end{itemize}

For example\textit { }oplus(oplus(oplus(oplus(1,oplus (2, 3)), 4) , 5),6). To leverage the input readability, two types of parenthesis, \textit {()} and \textit {{[}{]}} are supported, it means someone can input oplus{[}oplus{[}oplus(oplus(1, oplus (2, 3)),4), 5{]}, 6{]}
\end{itemize}

The program will output a term \textit t such that \textit {$val(t)=(G,\gamma)$} and \textit {red(t) = r} and the number of labels used in t is minimum. For example, with the reduced term r as above, the program will output: \textit{\seqsplit{rel\_c\_a[rel\_b\_a[add\_c\_b[oplus(rel\_c\_a[add\_b\_c[oplus(rel\_b\_a[add\_c\_a[oplus(rel\_c\_b[add\_c\_b[oplus(add\_b\_a[oplus(a(3),b(2))],c(1))]],c(4))]],b(5))]],c(6))]]]}}


%section 3.2 Program specification}%
\subsection{Program specification}

Our program is provided in two user interfaces: a console UI (User interface) and a graphical UI (GUI)
\begin{enumerate}
\item Console UI:
\begin{itemize}
\item The usage is as follows:\\
{$rcw.(bat|sh)\ input.txt\ [output.txt]$}

\item In the case output file is missing, term t will be printed out to
console 
\end{itemize}

\item Graphical UI (User Interface):
\begin{itemize}
\item We provide a GUI (Graphic User Interface) version of the program, to start it, just run:\\
{$rcwui.(bin|sh)$}
\item Following is a screen-shot of this GUI\\

\par\end{centering}

\end{figure}

\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

% 4. METHODS AND USED TOOLS %
\section {Methods and used tools}
Now is the time for us to look deeper into the details of implementing. Throughout this section, we will provide informations about the programming language, the processing of input data, and the data structure (or according to object oriented programming, the class diagram) we used

%section 4.1 Programming language%
\subsection{Programming language}
Our choice of programming language is Java. Java is a platform-independent language, so our program can run seamlessly on any operation system that supports Java (Windows, Linux, Mac OS ...). 

Beside that Java has a very big user-community, so we can find a big support from community for common problems we can cope with during implementation process. For example, to process data input, which we are about to discuss right after, we utilize a lexer/parser generator from public domain

% section 4.2 Processing of data input%
\subsection{Processing of data input}

As mentioned above, we have three types of input data 
\begin{enumerate}
\item The number of vertices of a graph 
\item The list of edges of the graph, for example: \textit {((1,2),(2,3),(3,4),(4,5),(5,6))}
\item A linear reduced term \textit {r}, for example:\textit {oplus(oplus(oplus(oplus(1,oplus(2,3)),4),5),6)}. To leverage the input readability, two types of parenthesis, () and {[}{]} are supported, e.g. someone can input \textit {oplus{[}oplus{[}oplus(oplus(1,oplus(2,3)),4),5{]},6{]}}
\end{enumerate}

Processing of (1) is trivial, (2) is less easy, and (3) is a bit difficult. Fortunately, we could overcome this problem quite quickly with so-called parser generator, and more fortunately, there are such
generators for Java. The one we chose is JavaCC \footnote {http://java.net/projects/javacc} - stands for Java Compiler Compiler, a very popular parser generator for Java. JavaCC takes a grammar specification written in Extended Backus Naur Form (EBNF), and then generates Java source code of the corresponding parser. JavaCC also comes with a specific tools JJTree \footnote {http://www.j-paine.org/dobbs/jjtree.html}, which helps to build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from data input to parser. So all the works we must do are just writing the context free grammar for (2) and (3) 

\begin{itemize}
\item Edge list
\begin{lstlisting}
COMMA = ",";
LP = "(";
RP = ")";
NUMBER = ['0'-'9']+;
VERTEX = NUMBER;
EDGE = LP VERTEX COMMA VERTEX RP;
EDGELIST = LP EDGE COMMA EDGE* RP;
\end{lstlisting}

\item Linear reduced term
\begin{lstlisting}
OPLUS = "oplus";
LP = "(";
RP = ")";
LSB = "[";
RSB = "]";
COMMA = ",";
NUMBER = (["0"-"9"])+;
VERTEX = NUMBER;
REDUCEDTERM = VERTEX |
      <OPLUS> <LP> VERTEX <COMMA> REDUCEDTERM <RP> |
      <OPLUS> <LP> REDUCEDTERM <COMMA> VERTEX <RP> |
      <OPLUS> <LSB> VERTEX <COMMA> REDUCEDTERM <RSB> |
      <OPLUS> <LSB> REDUCEDTERM <COMMA> VERTEX <RSB>;
\end{lstlisting}
 
\end{itemize}

% section 4.3 {Data structure}%
\subsection{Data structure}

Java is an OOP \footnote {Object-Oriented Programming} language, so to install the algorithm in Java, we need
to realize the incident notations to the algorithm (such as term,
graph) as Java classes. Following are class diagrams related to these
notations:

Some annotations:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit {Vertex} is class to abstract a vertex, each vertex has a list of adjacent vertices
\item \textit {VertexSet} is a class to abstract a set of vertices, \textit {VertexSet} supports some set operations such as subtract, union
\item \textit {VertexFamily} is a set of sets of vertices. We use \textit {VertexFamily} to denote notations such as \textit {set of partite sets}

We also setup a central source code repository for development process. The version control system we use is Git.

Our source code is hosted on github at https://github.com/pufm2/rcw

% RESULTS %
\section {Result}
We tested this program with some data tests as follows, program works fine all cases. You can find these tests in the Appendix section


% CONCLUSION %
\section {Conclusion}
The program basically meets the requirements, it is able to determines exactly relative clique width of a graph with respect to a linear reduced term. However, as mentioned above, there are still many things waiting to improve, especially about usability of the program.

The program basically satisfies the requirements. However the user interface is not really user-friendly and the usability should be improved more. For example, to increase usability, there are many things the program can do: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Support drawing graph 
\item Mapping from a sub-term of \textit {r} to the corresponding sub-graph 
\item Output the result step-by-step like the example we did above, so user
can easily verify the result 
\end{itemize}

Clique width as well as other parameters of graph is an interesting subject. Researching in this field is quite valuable. During this project, we have been known that we have more effective algorithms for determining clique width. So we believe one of further works we could try is to investigate those algorithms.

% ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS %
\section {Acknowledgements}
We would like to say a big thank to Professor Bruno COURCELLE – who has raised a very interesting project for us, graph decomposition, clique-width and their related problems were not familiar for us before and were not easy for us during the project. But with a continuous and enthusiastic support from Professor Courcell, we overcame many troubles and found our pleasure for the subject

Needless to say there are also many thanks from us  to Professor Maylis DELEST- who taught us how to plan a researching project and write a professional report, Professor Olivier BAUDON - who spent a lot of time to make us clear about this subject when he came to Viet Nam.

We also thank our classmates for their encouragements during our project.
